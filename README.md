#Casting Agency API Read Me

##Introduction
    Hello, and welcome to my Casting Agency API, which is the capstone
    project for the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree Program. I hope you have
    fun trying out the different endpoints and functionality.

    ###Motivation for project
        I completed this project as a way to learn more about SQLAlchemy 
        database backends, API building, third-party authorization, and heroku
        deployment. This API was designed to help people in the film industry
        view, edit, create, and delete data about actors and movies. These
        features can aid them in designing new film projects and organizing
        information about previous projects.
